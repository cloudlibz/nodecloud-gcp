# nodecloud-gcp-plugin
Google Cloud plugin for [nodecloud](https://github.com/cloudlibz/nodecloud)

## üöÄ Install

```
$ npm install nodecloud-gcp-plugin
OR
$ yarn add nodecloud-gcp-plugin
```

## ‚úåÔ∏è How to setup

- Download keyFile from GCP console
- Set environment variables

```
GCLOUD_PROJECT='nodecloud-demo',
GCLOUD_KEY_FILE_NAME='xxxxxxxxxxx'
```

Use same key names as they are used in this plugin implementation.

Make sure you have `.nc.config` file in the project root and have `nodecloud-core` installed.

Content of `.nc.config` file is assumed as the following json structure.
It is an array of supported providers.

1.  `name` : Provider name which nodecloud supports.
2.  `tag` : Name that you will use to load the given provider. It is for your reference in code. It can be anything that you may like.
3.  `libName` : Library name which has to be installed before loading a provider.

Config file can contain array of objects for all providers and all will be loaded.
Supported values for `name` : azure, google, aws

```js
const providers = [
    {
        name: 'google',
        tag: 'google',
        libName: 'nodecloud-gcp-plugin',
        configFile: {
            projectId: "YOUR_GCLOUD_PROJECT_ID",
            keyFilename: "ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_SERVICE_KEY"
        }
    },
    // other providers might be included here
]

module.exports = providers;
``` 

Here is how to obtain a service [key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

Remember that you need to give this service account appropiate roles!
